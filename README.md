This project is meant to exceed the requirements for Treehouse Project Six. 

I've made three CSS changes per the rubric, and it's worth mentioning that I'm not a designer. 

- Changed the font-family for h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and p to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif (style.css line 3).
- Changed the sidebar background color to #140936 (style.css line 61).
- Changed the link color on the sidebar to #c5c5c5 so it would better standout (style.css line 74).
